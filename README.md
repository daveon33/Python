# Arithmetic Operators

Integer: whole numbers
Floating-point numbers: numbers with a decimal point

An operator like division will cause the result to be a floating-point number. If an integer is needed as a result
python has the operator // *Integer division*, this will return an integer value as the result of the division.

Operators:

+ addition
- substraction
* multiply
/ divide
// integer division | Also known as *floor division* because it rounds down the result.
** power

Expressions:

It's the combination of numbers and operators that will return a result. An expression follows the PEMDAS order while
evaluating its content.

Arithmetic functions:

Python has some mathematical functions built in that could be useful while working with numbers, to use them we just
have to "call the function" by writing the name, followed by a parenthesis and inputing the values requiered for it
to perform the result. For example the abs() function will take a number and return its absolute value.

abs(-1) = 1

Strings:

A string is a sequence of characters and Python uses them quite often, to define one they have to be written inside
straight quotation marks, for example: 'Hello' and "This is a string". For this kind of data type we can  use the 
arithmetic operators + and * to concatenate strings or to add the same string to itself multiple times.

A commonly used string funcion is len() which will return a number with the amount of characters a string has.

Values and Types:

The prior mentioned data types are commonly used in Python and we could use them as well to change the type of a value,
for example the number 10.7, while using the funtion int(10.7) the result will be 10. 

We can know the type of a value by using the function type(value).

Also, while working with large numbers like 1000000, the underscore character can help make the number more readable while
keeping the same functionality 1_000_000.
